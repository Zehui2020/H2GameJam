  desc: "In 1984, because of fears that tunnelling for the Mass Rapid Transit system
    would cause cracks in the iron framework, a decision is taken to dismantle the
    market for reassembly later. \n\n In 1985, at least 140 hawkers stop operations,
    and most are moved across the street to the Transit Food Centre."
